### Implementation Considerations:

1. **Step-by-Step Upload Form**:
```dart
enum PropertyType { apartment, house, sharedRoom, studio, other }

class UploadFormSteps {
  static const List<String> steps = [
    "Basic Info",
    "Property Details",
    "Amenities",
    "Location",
    "Photos & Media",
    "Pricing",
    "Rules & Terms",
    "Review"
  ];
}
```

2. **Required vs Optional Fields**:
```dart
class RequiredFields {
  static const List<String> mandatory = [
    'title',
    'propertyType',
    'bedrooms',
    'bathrooms',
    'rentAmount',
    'address',
    'photos'
  ];
}
```

3. **Smart Defaults**:
- Prefill common values based on location/property type
- Suggest competitive pricing based on similar listings
- Automatically detect amenities from photos (AI-powered)

4. **Validation Rules**:
- Minimum photo requirements (5 photos)
- Price range validation based on location
- Address verification through map integration

5. **Progress Tracking**:
```dart
LinearProgressIndicator(
  value: currentStep / totalSteps,
)
```

This comprehensive list ensures landlords provide all necessary information while maintaining a streamlined user experience. The data collected would directly populate the detailed property listings that tenants see in the app, creating rich, informative listings that help tenants make informed decisions.
